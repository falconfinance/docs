### What Is Yap2Fly?&#x20;

[Yap2Fly](https://app.falcon.finance/yap2fly) is a joint quest between [Falcon Finance](https://falcon.finance/) and [Kaito](https://www.kaito.ai/) that turns both your voice and your onchain activity into real rewards.&#x20;

On X, Kaito‚Äôs Mindshare engine tracks how far your Falcon insights travel, scoring originality, thoughtful engagement, and genuine reach. In the Falcon app, every mint of USDf, stake of sUSDf, or addition of DeFi liquidity earns Falcon Miles and unlock new badge tiers.&#x20;

Your Mindshare and Miles work together to push you up the Yap2Fly leaderboard, unlocking monthly USDf bonuses and an allocation of special rewards.

### What Counts as a "Yap"?&#x20;

Begin by linking your X account to your [Falcon wallet ](https://app.falcon.finance/yap2fly)so Kaito can track the reach and impact of your posts. A strong yap delivers clear, original insight: walkthrough threads that demonstrate how to mint USDf, data-backed comparisons with other stablecoins, or concise tutorials guiding new users through staking or partaking in USDf DeFi ecosystem.\
Consistency is just as important as quality, because regular thoughtful updates mark you as a trustworthy voice in the ecosystem. Enhance your explanations with visuals like charts, short screen recordings, or annotated screenshots to make complex ideas easy to grasp and to invite deeper conversation.\
Let your own style shine, highlighting both the ‚Äúhow‚Äù and the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind Falcon Finance‚Äôs mechanism. Authentic commentary that educates and inspires earns higher Mindshare, which in turn lifts your position on the leaderboard.
