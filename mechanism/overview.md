### General Flow of User Deposits

1. Users deposit collateral assets into Falcon - these can range from stablecoins to non-stablecoin assets. USDf is minted in return.
2. All user deposits are routed to third-party custodians where multi-signature (multi-sig) or multi-party computation (MPC) processes are in place to ensure that assets are stored in a secure manner.
   1. These processes require multiple approvals from separate, authorized signers before any withdrawal can occur. Consequently, there is no single individual or entity that can unilaterally remove or re-route assets.
   2. Falcon does not directly control or hold user-deposited assets in a way that would allow a single party to misappropriate them.
3. Falcon utilizes off-exchange settlement mechanisms that allow for "mirroring" of assets within the custodian accounts onto CEXs, where various strategies are deployed and trades are placed.
4. Falcon deploys a portion of assets into tier-1 on-chain liquidity pools to generate yield through on-chain dex activity and arbitrage.
5. Falcon stakes certain assets on-chain for chains with native staking capabilities to generate additional yield on spot holdings.
