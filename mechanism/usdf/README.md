# USDf

USDf is Falcon's overcollateralized synthetic dollar, and one part of its dual-token system. USDf is minted when users deposit eligible collateral assets, including stablecoins (e.g., USDT, USDC, DAI) and non-stablecoin assets (e.g.,BTC, ETH, and [select altcoins](../../supported-assets.md)).

While minted at a 1:1 ratio for stablecoin deposits, Falcon subjects non-stablecoin assets to an overcollateralization ratio to ensure sufficient backing in times of market volatility, and preserve protocol integrity.
