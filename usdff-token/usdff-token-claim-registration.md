# $FF Token Claim Registration

Falcon Finance is opening registration for the upcoming $FF governance token. To participate, users must register their wallet addresses through the [Falcon Claim Page](https://app.falcon.finance/claims). Registration ensures that wallets are validated and eligible to receive tokens.

### Registration Deadline&#x20;

The registration period closes on **28th September, 23:59:59 UTC**. Only wallets registered before the deadline will be eligible to claim $FF tokens. Unregistered wallets will not be able to participate, so registering is a mandatory step to secure your claim.

### Claim Options

Once registered, you can decide how you would like to receive $FF tokens:

1. **Claim on Separate Wallets**
   1. Falcon Finance links wallet addresses based on X (Twitter) account connection. This means that if you have multiple wallet addresses connected to the same X (Twitter) account on Falcon App, the registration for these wallet addresses are linked and you have the choice to receive $FF tokens to each wallet.&#x20;
   2. Each registered wallet receives its share of tokens individually.&#x20;
   3. For example, you have Wallet A, B and C connected to @MyXAccount and you have registered Wallet A for separate wallet claims, your Wallet B and Wallet C will be automatically registered and each wallet A, B, and C will receive its token share during the claiming period.&#x20;
   4. If you only have one wallet address, this claim option will be the default selection.&#x20;
2. **Combined Claim to One Wallet**
   1. Falcon Finance links wallet addresses based on X account connection. This means that if you have multiple wallet addresses connected to the same X account on Falcon App, the registration for these wallet addresses are linked and you have the choice to receive all $FF token shares consolidated to one single wallet.&#x20;
   2. Tokens across all wallets linked to the same X account are merged and distributed to a single wallet of your choice.&#x20;
   3. For example, you have Wallet A, B and C connected to @MyXAccount and you have registered Wallet A for combined wallet claims, your Wallet B and Wallet C will be automatically registered and all of your eligible $FF claims will be consolidated and claimable through your selected wallet.&#x20;

### Linking Wallets to Your X Account

On the Falcon App, users may connect their wallet addresses to their X account on [Yap2Fly page](https://app.falcon.finance/yap2fly) or [Miles Leaderboard page](https://app.falcon.finance/miles?tab=leaderboard). If multiple wallets are linked under the same X account and at least one wallet is registered, all wallets connected to that X account will be auto-registered.

Connecting your X account is optional, but it provides key benefits:

* Required for users participating in the [Yap2Fly Board](https://app.falcon.finance/yap2fly), where X Kaito mindshare is factored into eligibility.
* Combine token claim registrations across multiple wallets under one X account.



### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)&#x20;

<details>

<summary>Do I need to register if I only have one wallet or have completed KYC? </summary>

Yes. Every wallet must be registered to be eligible for $FF claims. However, if you have multiple wallets connected to a X account, you are only required to register one of the wallets and the rest will be auto-registered. \
Do note that if you have multiple wallets that ARE NOT connected to the same X account, you will be required to register each and every wallet for its claims.&#x20;
