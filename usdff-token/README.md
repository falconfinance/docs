# $FF Tokens

The FF token will serve as the governance token of Falcon Finance and the foundation of the protocol’s decision-making and incentive framework. Through this mechanism, token holders will play an active role in shaping Falcon Finance’s ecosystem and long-term growth trajectory.

In addition to governance, staking or holding FF will unlock favorable economic terms within the protocol, including boosted APY on USDf staking, reduced overcollaterization ratios when minting, and discounted swap fees. These benefits are designed to enhance capital efficiency while encouraging both active participation and long-term alignment with the ecosystem.

A portion of the total FF supply will also be allocated to community incentives, with eligibility determined by user engagement across the Falcon ecosystem. Activities such as minting, staking, and participation in DeFi protocols and applications will contribute to reward qualification, ensuring a structured rollout of FF distribution that supports sustainable growth.

Finally, holding FF will provide privileged access to upcoming products and features, including early entry into new delta-neutral yield vaults and structured minting pathways. By combining governance rights, economic benefits, community rewards, and exclusive access, the FF token is positioned to become a central driver of value and participation within the Falcon Finance ecosystem.
