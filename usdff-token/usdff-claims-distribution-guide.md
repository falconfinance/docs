# $FF Claims Distribution Guide

This guide provides a complete walkthrough of the $FF claims process. It is designed to ensure full disclosure of FF claim eligibility, vesting schedules, claim flow, and the benefits of staking FF.&#x20;

### Claims Overview

The claims period is a limited-time event during which registered users can claim their $FF tokens.&#x20;

* Claims Period:
  * Opens: 29 September 2025, 12:00 UTC
  * Closes: 28 December 2025, 12:00 UTC&#x20;
* Claims Eligibility Categories: FF can be claimed through these 3 categories:&#x20;
  * Falcon Miles - Tokens allocation to users who have accumulated [Miles](https://app.falcon.finance/miles) by engaging with Falcon Finance ecosystem (eg: minting, staking, providing liquidity on DeFi, etc. ).&#x20;
  * Kaito Stakers - Users holding at least 5000 sKAITO or 5000 YT-sKAITO.&#x20;

   1. Timeline: 17 September 2025, 12:00 UTC – 28 September 2025, 23:59 UTC
   2. If you fail to register within this period, your claim is ineligible.&#x20;

**Step 3 – Allocation & Claims**

The section shows which categories you qualify for:

* Falcon Miles: You must select your vesting option before proceeding.
  * Option 1:
    * 30% unlocked at TGE.
    * Remaining 70% subject to 1-month cliff, then 6-months vesting.
  * Option 2:
    * 50% unlocked at TGE.
      * Remaining 50% forfeited (higher upfront access).
* Kaito Stakers
  * 40% unlocked at TGE; future unlocks tied to Falcon Badge tiers.
  * Remaining 60% unlocks gradually:
    1. 20% unlocks on 10 October – Claimable once you collect 3 Bronze Badges.
    2. 20% unlocks on 10 November – Claimable once you collect 3 Bronze + 4 Silver Badges.
    3. 20% unlocks on 10 December – Claimable once you collect 3 Bronze + 4 Silver + 4 Gold/Diamond/Legendary Badges.
*   Yap2Fly (Top 200)&#x20;

    * 40% unlocked at TGE; future unlocks tied to Falcon Badge tiers.
    *   Remaining 60% unlocks gradually:

        1. 20% unlocks on 10 October – Claimable once you collect 3 Bronze Badges.
        2. 20% unlocks on 10 November – Claimable once you collect 3 Bronze + 4 Silver Badges.
        3. 20% unlocks on 10 December – Claimable once you collect 3 Bronze + 4 Silver + 4 Gold/Diamond/Legendary Badges.

        Important Notes for Kaito Stakers and Yap2Fly Top 200 Rankers:

        — Unlocks are capped at 20% per date, even if you’ve already met all badge requirements before the first claim date.\
        — You can progressively unlock higher tiers over time. For example, if you don’t meet the Bronze badge requirement by October 10, but do so by November 10, you can start claiming from that point onward.

    Only Kaito Stakers and Yap2Fly Leaderboard users can claim their allocations in this step.

    * For Kaito Stakers and Yap2Fly: Click the “Claim” button next to each eligible category in Step 3.
    * For Falcon Miles: You will not see a Claim button in Step 3. Please proceed to Step 4 to claim your Falcon Miles allocation.

**Step 4 – Falcon Miles Claim & Stake**

This section shows Falcon Miles token claims that can be claimed and staked in a single transaction. Claims from Kaito staking and the Yap2Fly category must be claimed separately (Refer to step 3) and cannot be staked during the claim process.

The amount shown in Step 4 will only be allotted from the Falcon Miles category, which is the total amount of unlocked $FF tokens based on your vesting options

* In this step, you will decide how to split your unlocked $FF tokens between:
  * Staking FF for sFF (to earn APY and Falcon Miles multipliers).
  * Claiming FF directly to your onchain wallet.&#x20;

### Staking FF for Boosted Miles&#x20;

Staking your FF tokens for sFF during the claims process not only secures yield but also unlocks boosted Falcon Miles multipliers for [Season 2](https://app.falcon.finance/miles). These multipliers are designed to reward early participation and higher commitment.

Falcon Miles Multipliers&#x20;

* 160× Miles: For the first 7 days starting from TGE day (29 September 2025), users who hold sFF will earn 160 Miles for every 1 Mile normally earned.
* 80× Miles: After the 7th day (from 6 October 2025 onward), the multiplier adjusts to 80× for the remainder of Season 2.

This means the earlier you stake, the higher the multiplier you enjoy during TGE week.

Boosted Miles from Immediate Claim & Stake

In addition to the classic multipliers, users who claim and stake directly from the Claims page in a single transaction can unlock extra boosts on their entire Season 2 Miles. These boosts apply to all Miles you accumulate during the season, across all activities.

* Stake 50–79% of unlocked allocation → 1.1× Boost
  * Example: If you earn 10,000 Miles in Season 2, your boosted total becomes 11,000 Miles.
* Stake 80–100% of unlocked allocation → 1.25× Boost
  * Example: If you earn 10,000 Miles in Season 2, your boosted total becomes 12,500 Miles.

Important:

* The boost only applies if staking is completed as part of the claim transaction (Claim & Stake together).
* Staking later (after claiming) will not qualify for the boost.
