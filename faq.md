# FAQ

### KYC/ KYB Verification&#x20;

<details>

<summary><strong>What is KYC and KYB verification?</strong></summary>

KYC (Know Your Customer) and KYB (Know Your Business) are regulatory processes intended to verify the identity of individual users and businesses, respectively. These processes enable Falcon Finance to adhere to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations and maintain secure and compliant transaction practices.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>How can I initiate the KYC/KYB verification process on Falcon app?</strong></summary>

You may initiate this verification process by starting a [deposit](https://app.falcon.finance/transfer/deposit), [withdrawal](https://app.falcon.finance/transfer/withdraw), [mint](https://app.falcon.finance/swap/mint) or [redeem](https://app.falcon.finance/swap/redeem) action, at which a prompt will appear to guide you through the KYC/KYB verification steps.

<summary><strong>What documents are acceptable for Proof of Address (PoA)?</strong></summary>

The following documents are accepted as Proof of Address:

* Bank statements

</details>

<details>

<summary>I am a Chinese citizen or resident. What Proof of Address (PoA) documents should I submit? </summary>

For Chinese citizens or residents, we strongly recommend submitting bank statements as your Proof of Address (PoA). Bank statements typically include your full legal name and residential address clearly, facilitating a more efficient verification process. Utility bills from platforms such as WeChat or Alipay usually do not meet these requirements and often result in document resubmission and delays. Your cooperation in providing bank statements greatly assists us in swiftly processing your verification.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How long does the KYC/KYB Verification review process take? </summary>

The verification review process typically ranges from just a few minutes to 5 business days.

Please note that verification times may increase during periods of high market demand or increased verification volumes.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>What should I do if my KYC/KYB verification application is rejected?</strong></summary>

If your KYC or KYB verification application has been rejected, you may be required to resubmit certain documents or provide additional information. Please review the feedback provided carefully and resubmit as guided.&#x20;

However, if the submission does not meet our regulatory requirements, the rejection decision will be final. If you have any questions or require assistance, please feel free to contact us at support@falcon.finance.&#x20;

</details>

### Yield Accrual

<details>

<summary>What is sUSDf?</summary>

sUSDf is a yield-bearing token minted by staking USDf on Falcon Finance. It is designed to accrue value over time through Falcon's diversified, institutional-grade yield generation strategies.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I stake USDf to mint sUSDf?</summary>

1. Deposit USDf into the <kbd>Earn</kbd> module on Falcon. This locks your USDf and initiates the minting process for sUSDf.
2. sUSDf is minted based on the current sUSDf-to-USDf value, which reflects the total supply of sUSDf relative to the total USDf staked and accumulated protocol yield in USDf.
3. As Falcon generates yield through multiple trading strategies, the sUSDf-to-USDf value increases. This means your staked USDf generates yield which indirectly causes the appreciation of sUSDf.
4. sUSDf can be held for passive yield accrual or restaked for fixed-term boosted yields.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I earn APY through Falcon?</summary>

Stake USDf to Mint sUSDf:

1. Stake USDf on Falcon to mint sUSDf, a yield-bearing token.
2. Users earn a base yield, calculated based on a 7-day trailing APY derived from the protocol’s performance.
3. The value of sUSDf increases over time as yield accrues through Falcon’s yield generation strategies.

Boost Your Yield with Restaking sUSDf:

4. Restake sUSDf into fixed tenures of 3 months, 6 months, or other durations to earn boosted yields.
5. When restaking, Falcon issues an ERC-721 NFT to your wallet, representing the locked sUSDf and lock-up duration. This NFT accrues additional yield over the lock-up period.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I withdraw my assets at any time?</summary>

1. Yes, fully KYC-verified and whitelisted users can redeem USDf on demand.
2. Redeemed assets are subject to a 7-day cooling period before the original collateral becomes available for withdrawal.
3. The cooling period ensures proper settlement and asset processing.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does Falcon generate yield?</summary>

Falcon Finance expands on traditional synthetic dollar designs by integrating diversified collateral, including stablecoins, blue-chip tokens, and select altcoins, allowing the protocol to capitalize on distinct yield opportunities offered by various asset classes.&#x20;

Its institutional-grade yield generation strategies go beyond delta-neutral basis spreads and funding rate arbitrage, employing advanced statistical arbitrage algorithms to ensure consistent, risk-adjusted returns. These strategies leverage exchange arbitrage opportunities, exploiting micro market structure inefficiencies and funding rate variations while maintaining a delta-neutral position.&#x20;

By combining this robust approach with overcollateralized assets, Falcon Finance delivers sustainable and scalable yields across varying market conditions​​.



</details>

### Risk Management

<details>

<summary>How does Falcon manage risks?</summary>

1. Falcon combines automated systems and manual oversight to actively monitor and manage trading positions in real time. Automated systems continuously evaluate positions against risk thresholds and manual oversight by Falcon’s seasoned trading desk ensures an additional layer of evaluation and adjustment.&#x20;
2. During heightened market volatility, Falcon leverages the expertise of its seasoned trading desk and advanced infrastructure to strategically unwind risks.
3. Falcon continuously monitors market conditions, allowing for dynamic adaptation of strategies to mitigate risks and optimize yield generation during varying market scenarios.
4. In addition, Falcon ensures full operational transparency through detailed quarterly and annually Proof of Reserve (PoR) reports, consolidating on-chain and off-chain data, including collateral held by qualified custodians, balances on DEXs, CEXs, and protocol wallets. Independent third-party audits validate collateral adequacy, trading strategy compliance, and security protocols, including multi-signature schemes and MPC solutions. Users can access a real-time transparency dashboard displaying metrics such as Total Value Locked (TVL), the volume of sUSDf issued and staked, and the amount of USDf issued and staked.
5. Falcon commissions ISAE 3000 assurance reports to assess security, availability, transaction integrity, and privacy, reinforcing its commitment to trust and accountability.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does USDf aim to maintain its peg?</summary>

USDf is an overcollateralized synthetic dollar created when users deposit eligible assets into Falcon Finance.

For stablecoin deposits, USDf is minted at a 1:1 USD value ratio, ensuring straightforward stability. For non-stablecoin deposits such as BTC, ETH, or SOL, an overcollateralization ratio (OCR) is applied to account for potential market volatility and maintain full collateral backing.

The OCR acts as a buffer, safeguarding the protocol against market fluctuations while enabling Falcon to leverage a diverse set of yield-generating strategies. This dual benefit ensures USDf remains secure, robust, and optimized for user returns.
