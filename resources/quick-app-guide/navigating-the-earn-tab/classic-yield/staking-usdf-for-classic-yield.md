**Step 6: Confirm Staking via Falcon Account Overview**\
After staking is finalized and the transaction is confirmed, users should confirm that their newly minted assets are viewable under the Profile function located in the dropdown menu of the Account tab. \
Users should observe an increase in their Staked USDf balance corresponding to the total value of the recent staking, and a similar representation under their sUSDf balance. Over time, the value of these assets should increase, as yield is accrued.
