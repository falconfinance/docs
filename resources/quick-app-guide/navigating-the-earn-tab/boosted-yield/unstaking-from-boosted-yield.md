# Unstaking from Boosted Yield

### **Overview**

The Claim sub-function under the Boosted Yield Positions section of the Falcon Account Overview allows users who have restaked their USDf, or sUSDf for an ERC-721 NFT to claim their locked positions. Users will claim their locked positions in the form of sUSDT.

### **User Flow for Unstaking from Boosted Yield**

**Step 1: Navigate to the Claim Section**\
First, users locate the Account tab on the Falcon App, and select Profile from its dropdown menu. Then locate the Claim button under the Connected Wallet and Boosted Yield Positions sections.

**Step 2: Select Boosted Yield Position to Claim**\
Users will be able to view all their boosted yield positions under this section. However, only positions that have reached maturity (completed the selected tenure) will be eligible for claiming. Users should also take note of each position's principal, and yield accrued.\
Users select the locked position that they intend to claim and click Claim. This will trigger a transaction.

**Step 3: Approve Transaction**\
Users will be required to confirm and authorize the transaction within their Web3 wallet.

**Step 4: Confirm Restaking via Falcon Account Overview**\
After restaking is finalized and the transaction is confirmed, users should confirm that their newly claimed assets are viewable under the Profile function located in the dropdown menu of the Account tab. \
Alongside the claimed boosted yield position no longer being displayed under the Boosted Yield Positions section, users should observe a decrease in their staked sUSDf balance, and an equivalent increase in sUSDf balance.\
&#xNAN;_&#x54;his change in sUSDf balance should be equivalent to the sum of the boosted yield position's principal and yield accrued as mentioned in Step 2._
