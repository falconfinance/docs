# Restaking for Boosted Yield

### **Overview**

Users can restake either USDf or sUSDf into fixed-term vaults to unlock boosted yield opportunities. Upon restaking, their position is represented by an ERC-721 NFT, which encodes the restaked amount, tenure duration, and maturity date.&#x20;

This NFT is transferable and provides flexibility for managing or exiting yield positions.
