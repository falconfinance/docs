# Minting with Stablecoins

### User Flow for Minting USDf with Stablecoins

**Step 1: Navigate to the Mint Section**\
First, users locate the Swap tab on the Falcon App, and select "**Mint**" from its dropdown menu.

**Step 2: Select Collateral Asset and Indicate Amount**\
Users select a stablecoin from existing deposits in their Falcon Account, and indicate the desired amount to use as collateral for minting USDf.

**Step 3a: Mint USDf**\
Once the collateral asset and amount are selected, users can initiate the minting of USDf to their connected Web3 wallet by clicking the Mint button. This will trigger a transaction.

**Step 3b: Mint and Stake USDf**\
Furthermore, users can opt into an Express Mint. By selecting the Receive sUSDf option, users' newly minted USDf is automatically staked, skipping the intermediate step of manually staking it. These users will directly receive sUSDf instead of USDf, and be entitled to any Basic Yield accrued.&#x20;

**Step 3c: Mint, Stake, and Restake USDf**\
Users opting into an Express Mint can also select the Boost Yield option. This option works similar to the Receive sUSDf option in Step 3b, with the addition of restaking users' sUSDf into fixed-term vaults (e.g., 3 or 6 months). Users who select this option will receive varying yields based on the tenure chosen, on top of Basic Yield accrued on their sUSDf. They will also receive an ERC-721 NFT representing their locked up position instead of USDf or sUSDf.

**Step 4: Approve Transaction**\
Users will be required to confirm and authorize the transaction within their Web3 wallet. \
&#xNAN;_&#x4D;inting USDf will require manual review and approval from Falcon, and while the service-level agreement (SLA) lasts for a 24-hour period, this process is expected to be processed within minutes._

**Step 5: Confirm Minting via Falcon Account Overview**\
After minting is finalized and the transaction is confirmed, users should confirm that their newly minted assets are viewable under the Profile function located in the dropdown menu of the Account tab. This will differ based on the variation of Step 3 followed by users:

* Step 3a: Observe an increase in their USDf balance corresponding to the total value of their recent mint.
* Step 3b: Observe an increase in their sUSDf balance corresponding to the total value of their recent mint.
* Step 3c: Observe a new position under Boosted Yield Positions, displaying their Yield %, Principal, Value, Maturity, and Yield Accrued.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x41;dditionally, users may click on the shortcut under NFT to view their ERC-721 NFT on the respective block explorers._
