# Innovative Mint

_**Disclaimer: The minimum amount required to initiate an Innovative Mint is USD$50,000 worth of eligible non-stablecoin collateral. Users seeking to participate can contact support@falcon.finance for further information and assistance.**_

### Overview

The Innovative Mint function within the Swap tab allows users to initiate USDf minting using non-stablecoin assets in their Falcon Account as collateral. Users commit their assets for a fixed tenor, and minting parameters such as strike price and liquidation thresholds are set during the process. Minting USDf through Innovative Mint requires manual review and approval from Falcon, and while the service-level agreement (SLA) lasts for a 24-hour period, the process is expected to be completed within minutes.

Refer to the [Supported Assets](../../../supported-assets.md) section for further details on eligible deposit assets.

### **Staking**

After verification of a successful mint, users are encouraged to participate in staking and other yield features within the Falcon App with their USDf.

Refer to the [Classic Yield](../navigating-the-earn-tab/classic-yield/) section under the [Earn](../navigating-the-earn-tab/) tab for further details.

**Step 2: Select Your Non-Stablecoin Collateral and Input a Minimum of USD$50,000 Worth of Asset, Then Choose Your Tenor Lock-Up**

Choose your preferred non-stablecoin asset (e.g., ETH) and input the amount to deposit. A minimum of USD 50,000 in collateral value is required to proceed. Next, select your desired lock-up duration from the available tenors: 90, 180, or 365 days. This defines how long your collateral will remain committed and when redemption will be available.

**Step 3: Set Your Strike Multiplier (Risk Level)**

Select a strike multiplier (e.g., 100%, 150%, 200%, etc.). This setting defines your strike price and impacts the amount of USDf you receive. The strike multiplier also influences the liquidation threshold and defines the price range in which your position remains active.

Use the chart and efficiency indicators to understand your selected risk range and the potential payoff.

**Step 4: Enable Auto-Staking (optional)**&#x20;

If desired, toggle the option to automatically stake your newly minted USDf into Falcon’s vaults and begin earning yield in the form of sUSDf. You may choose to receive sUSDf, which can be unstaked at any time, or opt to boost yield by locking it for a fixed term.

**Step 5: Review Your Position**

Carefully review the summary displayed on the right panel on Total collateral deposited, USDf to be received, Strike price, Market price, Liquidation price, Lock-up duration, and staking option. &#x20;

Ensure all values are accurate and aligned with your intended strategy as this action is irreversible.&#x20;
