# Roadmap

Falcon Financeâ€™s 2025 and 2026 roadmap sets out the next phase of development across product and banking rails, collateral eligibility, USDf integrations and versions including multi chain support, regulatory and TradFi enablement.&#x20;

The objectives are to expand secure global access, introduce measured multi-asset collateralization with defined risk and treasury controls, extend USDf utility across DeFi and institutional platforms, and advance the legal and operational foundations required for real world asset connectivity. Sequencing reflects market readiness, partner onboarding, security reviews, and compliance requirements.&#x20;

The table below presents the planned initiatives and milestones for each track and will be updated as approvals and market conditions evolve.
