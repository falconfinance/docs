The Insurance Fund exists to safeguard the protocol during adverse conditions and to promote orderly markets for USDf. Its primary role is to absorb and smooth rare periods of negative yield performance by providing a financial buffer. When market liquidity for USDf becomes dislocated, the fund may operate as a market backstop by purchasing USDf in open markets in measured size and at transparent prices, with the objective of restoring orderly trading and minimizing risk. During episodes of exceptional, system-wide stress, Falcon Finance may supplement the fund and deploy capital to preserve protocol stability and continuity of operations.&#x20;
