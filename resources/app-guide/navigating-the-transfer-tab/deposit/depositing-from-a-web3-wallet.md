**Step 4: Indicate Amount and Deposit Assets**\
Once the deposit asset and network are selected, users can enter the amount of assets they intend to deposit into their Falcon Account and initiate it by clicking the Deposit button. This will trigger the transaction.\
&#xNAN;_&#x56;erify the network selected again before initiating the deposit. Depositing assets through unsupported networks may result in loss of funds._

**Step 5: Approve Transaction**\
Users will be required to confirm and authorize the transaction within their Web3 wallet.

**Step 6:  Confirm Deposit via Falcon's Account Overview**\
After the deposit is finalized and the transaction is confirmed, users should confirm that their deposited assets are viewable under the Profile function located in the dropdown menu of the Account tab.\
Users should observe an increase in their Portfolio Value corresponding to the total value of the recent deposit, and a similar representation under Available Assets.
