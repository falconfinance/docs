# Deposit

### **Overview**

The Deposit function within the Transfer tab allows users to initiate asset transfers into their Falcon Account. Users may deposit a range of supported stablecoins and non-stablecoin assets across various chains to begin minting USDf.\
Refer to the [Supported Assets](../../../../supported-assets.md) section for further details on eligible deposit assets.

### **Minting**

After verification of a successful deposit, users are encouraged to mint USDf, using their deposited assets as collateral. This will allow them to participate in staking and other yield features on Falcon.\
Refer to the [Mint](../../navigating-the-swap-tab/mint/) section under the [Swap](../../navigating-the-swap-tab/) tab for further details.
