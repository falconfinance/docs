# Locked Positions

Locked Positions are a representation of users' non-stablecoin assets that have been locked as collateral to mint USDf. These will be displayed under the Locked Positions section within users' Falcon Account Overview.

### Example

<figure><img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-08 at 11.57.18 AM.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In the image provided above, a user has a Locked Position with the following details:

* Asset: ETH
* Amount: 500 ETH
* Initial Mark Price: $1,580.39 per ETH
* Overcollateralization Ratio (OCR): 5%
* Overcollateralization Ratio (OCR) Buffer Amount: 25 ETH
* USDf Minted: 750,685.9691 USDf

The terms above and their respective values are defined and calculated as such:

**Overcollateralization Ratio (OCR)**\
An Overcollateralization Ratio (OCR) is set to indicate a user's total value of locked collateral relative to the amount of minted USDf.&#x20;

$$
\text{OCR} = \frac{\text{Initial Mark Price of Collateral} \times \text{Collateral Amount}}{\text{USDf Minted}}
$$

Using the example scenario, the user's USDf minted amount is calculated as:&#x20;

$$
\text{USDf Minted} = 500 \times 1580.39 \times 0.05 = 750,685.9691
$$

**Overcollateralization Ratio (OCR) Buffer Amount**&#x20;

OCR Buffer Amount is the portion of collateral retained by Falcon beyond the value of minted USDf. The buffer serves as a risk mitigation mechanism to safeguard the protocol against market fluctuations.&#x20;



The amount of collateral asset held as an OCR buffer should be equivalent to OCR \* total amount of total collateral locked

**USDf Minted**

The USDf Minted value represents the total amount of USDf minted to the users' connected wallet by locking non-stablecoin collateral (e.g. ETH). This figure reflects the borrowing capacity granted to you based on the protocolâ€™s Overcollateralization Ratio (OCR) rules.

To fully unwind your position and reclaim your locked collateral, you are required to repay the exact amount of USDf minted, in this case - 750,685.9691 USDf.

Once the USDf has been successfully repaid, the corresponding collateral (e.g. 500 ETH) will be unlocked and returned to your Falcon Account.
