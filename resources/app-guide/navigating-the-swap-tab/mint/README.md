# Mint

### **Overview**

The Mint function within the Swap tab allows users to initiate USDf minting using existing deposit assets in their Falcon Account as collateral. Users can mint USDf with a range of stablecoins and non-stablecoin assets. Minting USDf will require manual review and approval from Falcon, and while the service-level agreement (SLA) lasts for a 24-hour period, this process is expected to be processed within minutes.

Refer to the [Supported Assets](../../../../supported-assets.md) section for further details on eligible deposit assets.

### **Staking**

After verification of a successful mint, users are encouraged to participate in staking and other yield features within the Falcon App with their USDf.

Refer to the [Classic Yield](../../navigating-the-earn-tab/classic-yield/) section under the [Earn](../../navigating-the-earn-tab/) tab for further details.
