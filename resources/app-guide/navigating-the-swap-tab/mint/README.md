# Mint

### **Overview**

The Mint function within the Swap tab allows users to initiate USDf minting using existing deposit assets in their Falcon Account as collateral. Users can mint USDf with range of stablecoins and non-stablecoin assets.\
Refer to the [Supported Assets](../../../../supported-assets.md) section for further details on eligible deposit assets.

### **Staking**

After verification of a successful mint, users are encouraged to participate in staking and other yield features within the Falcon App with their USDf.\
Refer to the [Classic (Yield Stake)](../../navigating-the-earn-tab/classic-yield/staking-with-classic-yield.md) section under the [Earn](../../navigating-the-earn-tab/) tab for further details.
