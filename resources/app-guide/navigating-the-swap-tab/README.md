# Navigating the Swap Tab

The Swap tab aims to facilitate USDf mints and redemptions. Users can utilise their deposited assets within their Falcon Account to mint a corresponding amount of USDf, with non-stablecoin assets subject to an overcollateralization ratio. They can also redeem and convert their existing USDf back into their initial assets for withdrawal to their Web3 wallets.

This section outlines the operational steps for both the Mint and Redeem functions.
