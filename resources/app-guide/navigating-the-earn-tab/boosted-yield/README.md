# Boosted Yield

#### **Overview**

The Boosted Yield function within the **Earn** tab allows users to restake their sUSDf into fixed-term vaults to enhance yield performance. By locking their sUSDf for a pre-defined period (e.g., 3 or 6 months), users are issued a time-locked ERC-721 position token, which represents their boosted staking position and accrues additional yield over time.

Users can also utilize the **Express Mint** feature to directly mint into a Boosted Yield position from deposited collateral, skipping the intermediate step of staking to sUSDf.

Refer to the [Classic Yield](../classic-yield/) under the Earn tab for further context on acquiring sUSDf.&#x20;
