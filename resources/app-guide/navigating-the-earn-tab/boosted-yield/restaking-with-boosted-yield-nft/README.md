# Restaking with Boosted Yield NFT

**Overview**\
Users can restake either USDf or sUSDf into fixed-tenor vaults to unlock boosted yield opportunities. Upon restaking, their position is represented by an ERC-721 NFT, which encodes the restaked amount, tenor duration, and maturity. This NFT is transferable and provides flexibility for managing or exiting yield positions.&#x20;

This guide outlines the step-by-step process for restaking USDf or sUSDf and tracking the associated NFT positions.
