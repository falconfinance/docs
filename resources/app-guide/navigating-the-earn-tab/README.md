# Navigating the Earn Tab

The Earn tab facilitates staking unstake on Falconâ€™s vaults. Users can stake USDf to mint yield-bearing sUSDf, or further enhance yields by restaking sUSDf into fixed-term ERC-721 NFT. This section provides step-by-step instructions for staking, restaking, and unstaking operations.

#### Classic Yield

The Classic Yield option allows users to stake USDf directly into the Falcon's vault, minting sUSDf to accrue base yields without any lock-up period.

#### Boosted Yield

The Boosted Yield option enables users to enhance their yields by restaking sUSDf into ERC-721 NFT with fixed tenures (e.g., 3 or 6 months). Users may unstake their NFT positions upon maturity to redeem their accumulated yields in sUSDf.&#x20;
