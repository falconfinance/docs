# Classic Yield

### Overview

The Classic Yield function within the Earn tab allows users to stake their minted USDf in exchange for yield-bearing sUSDf, and also unstake their sUSDf. Users can stake USDf without any lock-up period, allowing them to flexibly unstake sUSDf back into USDf at the prevailing sUSDf-to-USDf Value at the time of unstaking.\
Refer to the [Mint](../../navigating-the-swap-tab/classic-mint/) section under the [Swap](../../navigating-the-swap-tab/) tab for further details on acquiring USDf.
