# Staking Vaults

Staking Vaults are an onchain product offered by Falcon Finance that enables users to earn USDf rewards on their digital asset holdings without selling their the tokens or completing KYC. The vaults aggregate TVL in strategic assets and deploy them into yield generating strategies, creating sustainable rewards for users while strengthening the Falcon ecosystem.

### Key Features&#x20;

1. **Stake your Tokens**&#x20;
   1. Users can deposit supported tokens into dedicated vaults. Once deposited, the assets enter a lockup period and begin earning rewards.
2. **Earn USDf Yield**
   1. Yield is distributed in USDf at a fixed APR. The vault does not mint USDf from user staking.&#x20;
3. **Lockup Duration**
   1. Each vault offers specific lockup periods (eg: 180 days). Once the lockup duration ends, users can unstake and withdraw the same quantity of their deposited tokens.&#x20;
4. **Proprietary Yield Generation**
   1. Falcon Finance generates yield through propriety trading. All strategies follow Falcon internal risk processes.
5. **Unstake Cooldown**
   1.  After the lockup duration ends, users can initiate an unstake of the token from the Staking Vault. A 3-day cooldown period applies to allow strategies to unwind. Once the cooldown is complete, users can redeem their original tokens.
