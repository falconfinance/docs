# sFF Token

## Overview

sFF is the staked version of the FF governance token, minted when users stake FF into Falcon Finance's staking mechanism. By staking FF to receive sFF, users unlock enhanced  benefits within the Falcon Finance ecosystem, including yield generation, boosted Falcon Miles multipliers, and governance participation rights.

Staking FF aligns long-term holders with the protocol's growth while providing tangible rewards for active participation. sFF holders benefit from:

* **Yield Generation**: Earn yield distributed in $FF
* **Falcon Miles Multipliers**: Earn accelerated Miles for Season 2 and beyond
* **Governance Rights**: Participate in protocol decision-making (coming soon)
