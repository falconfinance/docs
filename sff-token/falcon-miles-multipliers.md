#### Claim Staking Bonuses

For users claiming FF tokens from the TGE distribution, additional bonuses apply when staking during the claims process:

| Staking Amount             | Bonus Multiplier  | Example                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| Stake ≥50% of claimable FF | 1.10x (10% boost) | 10,000 Miles → 11,000 Miles |
| Stake ≥80% of claimable FF | 1.25x (25% boost) | 10,000 Miles → 12,500 Miles |

| Activity                       | Multiplier | Notes                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **sFF Holding (First 7 Days)** | 160x       | Applicable to first 7 days after initial stake |
| **sFF Holding (Ongoing)**      | 80x        | Standard multiplier after initial 7-day period |

> **Important**: These bonuses require staking to be executed as part of the claims transaction. The claim and stake must occur together in a single transaction. Any staking performed separately after the claim will not qualify for these bonus multipliers.

Miles earned through sFF staking contribute to your overall Falcon Miles balance and count toward Season 2 rewards&#x20;
