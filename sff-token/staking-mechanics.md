# Staking Mechanics

#### How sFF Works

When you stake FF tokens, you receive sFF in return at a 1:1 ratio. Your sFF represents your staked position and accrues value over time through yield distribution.

The staking mechanism operates as follows:

1. **Stake FF**: stake $FF through the protocol via [https://app.falcon.finance/earn/classic](https://app.falcon.finance/earn/classic)
2. **Receive sFF**: Mint sFF tokens representing your staked position
3. **Accrue Yield**: Earn yield distributed in $FF based on protocol performance
4. **Earn Miles**: Accumulate Falcon Miles with boosted multipliers
5. **Unstake Anytime**: Convert sFF back to FF. Please do note that a 3 day cooldown period applies for users wishing to unstake.

#### Unstaking Process

sFF features **unstaking** with a &#x33;**-day cooldown period**. This means:

* You can initiate the conversion from sFF to FF at any time. Once initiated, your FF becomes claimable after a 3-day cooldown period. During this cooldown, your tokens do not accrue yield.
* Unstaking does not affect any yield you've already earned
* Unstaking is processed immediately upon transaction confirmation
