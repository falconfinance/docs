# Falcon Miles

**Falcon Miles Pilot Season** is focused on incentivizing core activities on the Falcon app and DeFi liquidity activities. Users can earn Miles by performing eligible actions such as minting USDf, staking, restaking, contributing liquidity, or trading on DeFi pools.&#x20;

### How it Works

Falcon Miles operates on a multiplier-based system. For each eligible activity you perform, points are awarded based on the USD value of the activity, either the USDf minted or the total value locked (TVL) of the collateral.

**Example 1: Minting USDf via the Classic Mint with Non-stablecoins**\
If you mint USDf worth 10,000 and the multiplier for this action is 8x, you will receive 80,000 Miles.

**Example 2: Holding USDf for a day.** \
If you hold $10,000 worth of USDf in your wallet for one day and the daily holding multiplier is 6x, you will earn 60,000 Miles.

> **Note:** The "Daily Earned Miles" displayed on your dashboard reflect the Miles earned from **the previous day’s activities**.

_**Disclaimer: Any attempt to abuse the program will result in removal of points or disqualification, to ensure fair distribution to the Falcon community.**_

### Earning Miles&#x20;

There are several ways to earn Miles during this Pilot Season:

1. **Mint, Stake, Hold**&#x20;
   1. You can mint USDf through either Classic or Innovative Mint, with rewards varying based on the type of collateral supplied. Once minted, holding USDf in your wallet earns you Miles passively over time. You can also stake your USDf to receive sUSDf, or go further by restaking sUSDf into Boosted Yield vaults for even higher long-term returns. The longer you hold or commit, the more you earn.
2. **DeFi Liquidity**
   1. Beyond the Falcon app, you can earn Miles by contributing USDf liquidity to supported decentralized exchanges, such as Uniswap, Curve, Balancer, PancakeSwap, and Bunni.
      1. Retroactive rewards will be issued to early liquidity providers, recognizing those who helped seed the protocol from the start.
   2. Trading activity on Uniswap v3 is now eligible for Miles. You’ll earn daily rewards based on the total volume you trade.
3. **Referrals**
   1.  Through our referral program:

       * Earn up to 10% of the Miles your referee earns.
       * Set your own kickback: give as much (or as little) back as you like.

       Please note:

       * Referrer: You’ll only earn Miles if the person you invite connects their wallet to Falcon app for the first time using your referral link.
       * Referee: To receive your referral bonus, you must have never connected to Falcon app before, and you must use a referral link on your first connection.

       You can find and customize your referral link on the [Miles page](https://app.falcon.finance/miles).
4. **Social Tasks**
   1. Be part of our community and earn Miles, whilst staying plugged into the latest updates of Falcon's roadmap and milestones.&#x20;
