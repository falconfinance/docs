# Falcon Miles

_**Please note this is the initial rollout of Falconâ€™s Miles Program. At this stage, only core activities within the Falcon App such as minting, staking, and restaking are being tracked for points. Activities involving external protocol partners may be included in future phases. Where relevant, eligible actions on these platforms may be awarded points retroactively.**_

The Miles Program uses a multiplier-based system. Points are awarded based on both the scale of your activity and the duration of your engagement.

Each action has an associated multiplier, which is applied to the USD value of that activity, either the USDf minted or the total value locked (TVL) of the collateral.

**Example 1: Minting USDf via the Classic Mint with Stablecoins**\
If you mint USDf worth 10,000 and the multiplier for this action is 2x, you will receive 20,000 Miles.

_**Please note that this minting reward is capped at the first 1,000,000 USDf minted for each user.**_

**Example 2: Holding USDf for a day.** \
If you hold $10,000 worth of USDf in your wallet for one day and the daily holding multiplier is 6x, you will earn 60,000 Miles

Current multiplier values and eligible activities are listed on the [Miles page](https://app.falcon.finance/miles). Please note that improvements and updates are ongoing during this early phase.

_**Disclaimer: Any attempt to abuse the program will result in removal of points or disqualification, to ensure fair distribution to the Falcon community.**_
