**Step 5: Receive Yield-Bearing sUSDf**

Your staked USDf is now represented as sUSDf, Falcon Finance's yield-bearing token.&#x20;

As Falcon Finance generates yield through its diversified yield strategies, the sUSDf-to-USDf value increases, reflecting accrued yields.&#x20;

Your sUSDf balance can be verified in your Falcon Account under the "Connected Wallet" Section.
