# Classic Yield

#### Overview

The Classic Yield function within the Earn tab enables users to stake their minted USDf in exchange for yield-bearing sUSDf tokens. Users can stake USDf without any lock-up period, allowing them to flexibly unstake sUSDf back into USDf at the prevailing sUSDf-to-USDf Value.

Refer to the [Mint](../../navigating-the-swap-tab/mint/) section under the [Swap](../../navigating-the-swap-tab/) tab for further details on acquiring USDf.
