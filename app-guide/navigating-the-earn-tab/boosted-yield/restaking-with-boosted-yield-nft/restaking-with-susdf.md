# Restaking with sUSDf

### Userflow for Restaking sUSDf into Fixed-Term Vaults to Receive Position NFT

**Step 1: Navigate to the Boosted Yield Section**

Begin by accessing the **"Boosted Yield"** page within the **"Earn"** tab on the Falcon App.

Alternatively, navigate to the **"Account"** tab where your wallet overview is displayed. Under the sUSDf section, click **"Boost Yields"** to initiate a fixed-tenor restaking.

**Step 3: Select a Fixed Tenor Duration**

Choose a fixed-tenor period from the available options (e.g., 3 months, 6 months, or 12 months).\
The longer the selected tenor, the higher the Boosted APY.

**Step 4: Confirm the Restaking Transaction**

Carefully review the restaking details. Once confirmed, proceed to confirm spending cap and transaction request using your connected wallet (e.g., MetaMask).

Upon successful transaction, a “Transaction Complete” message will be displayed.

**Step 6: Confirm Transaction and View Updated Account Balances**

After successfully authorizing the restaking transaction in your wallet, Falcon will lock the specified amount of sUSDf into a fixed-term staking vault based on your selected duration.

Navigate back to your Falcon Dashboard to view the updated balances:

* **sUSDf Balance:** Reduced by the restaked amount.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x45;xample:_ 8,370.3 → 5,370.3 sUSDf
* **Staked sUSDf Balance:** Increased to reflect the total locked capital.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x45;xample:_ 4,185.15 → 7,185.15 sUSDf

These changes confirm that your assets are now earning boosted yield under the selected fixed-term tenor. In this scenario, the sUSDf is restaked for a 3-month term.

**Step 7: Receive and Track Your Boosted Yield NFT Position**

Upon successful restaking, the protocol will automatically mint a unique ERC-721 NFT that represents your fixed-term yield position. The NFT encodes key data such as the principal amount (in sUSDf), the selected staking duration, and the expected maturity date.

This NFT serves as proof of your locked position and can be tracked under the **"Boosted Yield Positions"** section of the dashboard. It is transferable, enabling future utility across supported platforms or secondary markets.&#x20;
