# Unstaking from Boosted Yield NFT to sUSDf

Step-by-Step Userflow for Unstaking ERC-721 NFT Boosted Yield Positions

**Step 1: Navigate to the Claim Section on your Falcon Account**

Begin by accessing the **"Claim"** page within the Falcon App. Navigate to the "**Account"** tab and go to the **"Boosted Yield Positions"** to view all your active and matured ERC-721 staking positions.

Choose the ERC-721 Boosted Yield Position that has reached its maturity. Only positions that have completed the selected fixed-tenor duration (e.g., 3, 6, or 12 months) will be eligible for claim.

**Step 2: Receive sUSDf and View Updated Account Balances**\
Once the claim is executed, the protocol will return both your original staked sUSDf and any accrued yield from the matured Boosted Yield Position directly to your connected wallet. These funds will appear under your **Available sUSDf Balance**, while your **Staked sUSDf Balance** will decrease by the claimed amount.

**Example:**\
You receive **4,185.15 sUSDf** (principal) and **29.02 sUSDf** (accrued yield).

* **Available sUSDf Balance:** 5,370.3 sUSDf +4,214.17 sUSDf = 9,584.47 sUSDf
* **Staked sUSDf Balance:** 7,185.15 sUSDf â€“4,185.15 sUSDf = 3,000 sUSDf

This confirms the full redemption of your fixed-term staking position and the successful transfer of both capital and rewards.
