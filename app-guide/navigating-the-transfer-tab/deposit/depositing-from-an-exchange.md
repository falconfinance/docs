**Step 3: Deposit Assets**\
Once the deposit asset and network are selected, users can proceed to initiate the deposit into their Falcon Account. Users can either scan the provided QR code or manually copy the deposit address and paste it into their exchange withdrawal interface.\
&#xNAN;_&#x56;erify the network selected again before initiating the deposit. Depositing assets through unsupported networks may result in loss of funds._

**Step 4:  Confirm Deposit via Falcon's Account Overview**\
After the deposit is finalized and the transaction is confirmed, users should confirm that their deposited assets are viewable under the Profile function located in the dropdown menu of the Account tab.\
Users should observe an increase in their Portfolio Value corresponding to the total value of the recent deposit, and a similar representation under Available Assets.
