**Using Falcon Finance**

Falcon Finance is a platform that helps users earn steady returns by using different investment strategies. Unlike other synthetic dollar systems that depend on a single way to generate returns, Falcon Finance uses a mix of techniques like funding rate arbitrage, price differences between markets, and a combination of safe and higher-risk strategies.

## **How It Works**

Falcon Finance has two types of tokens to help users manage their investments:

* **USDf (Overcollateralized Synthetic Dollar):** A digital dollar backed by assets like stablecoins (USDT, USDC, FDUSD), BTC, ETH, and select altcoins. USDf is stable and is the first step for earning yield.
* **sUSDf (Yield-Bearing Asset):** A token that increases in value over time. Falcon Finance earns yield through different strategies like trading across exchanges, funding rate arbitrage, and staking. As returns grow, the value of sUSDf increases compared to USDf.

## **User Flow for Stablecoins**

* **Deposit Stablecoins**\
  Users can deposit **stablecoins** (such as **USDT**, **USDC**, **FDUSD**) into their **Falcon Wallet** via exchanges or wallets. These assets are typically used for low-volatility transactions, staking, or yield strategies.
* **Mint USDf**\
  Users can mint **USDf** by depositing stablecoins. **USDf** is a tokenized version of the stablecoins, and it can be used for **staking** or **yield generation** within the app.
* **Stake for Classic or Boosted Yield**\
  Users can mint **USDf** by depositing stablecoins. USDf is a tokenized version of the stablecoins, and it can be used for staking and generating yields within the app.
* **Redeem USDf to Stablecoins**\
  Once users are ready to exit the yield process, they can **redeem** their **USDf** back into **stablecoins** such as **USDT**, **USDC**, or **FDUSD**, ensuring they retain their stable value.
* **Withdraw Stablecoins**\
  Users can withdraw their stablecoins (USDT, USDC, FDUSD, USDf, or sUSDf) from their Falcon account to their connected online wallet.

## **User Flow for Non-Stablecoins**

* **Deposit Non-Stablecoins Collateral**\
  Users can deposit **non-stablecoin collateral** (like **ETH**, **BTC**, **XRP**, etc.) into their **Falcon Wallet**. These assets are more volatile but offer higher potential yield and growth.
* **Mint USDf (Non-Stablecoin)**\
  Users can mint **USDf** by depositing **non-stablecoins collateral**. During the minting process, Falcon App applies an **Overcollateralization Ratio (OCR)**, ensuring that a higher amount of collateral is deposited than the minted **USDf** value. This is done to manage risk and protect both the user and the platform.\
  &#xNAN;_&#x45;xample:_ If a user deposits **5 ETH**, the platform will apply the **OCR** and mint a proportionate amount of **USDf** based on the current market value and OCR.
* **Stake for Boosted Yield**\
  Users can stake **USDf** or **sUSDf** for a fixed yield over time, either through **Classic Yield** or **Boosted Yield** options. Longer lock-up periods can offer higher rewards.
* **Unlock Position**\
  Users can claim their **non-stable coin** locked position. They have the option to claim with:
  * **Non-stable coin** (the one you locked with)
  * **USDT**
  * **Non-stable coin + USDT**
* **Withdraw Non-Stablecoins or Redeemed USDf**\
  Finally, Users can withdraw their **non-stablecoins** or USDf and sUSDf back to an external wallet.
