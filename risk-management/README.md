# Risk Management

Risk management is a cornerstone of Falcon’s commitment to users’ asset protection. Falcon\
employs a dual-layered approach combining automated systems and manual oversight to monitor\
and manage positions actively. This double monitoring layer ensures positions are carefully evaluated and adjusted in real-time to mitigate risk.&#x20;

During periods of heightened market volatility, Falcon leverages the expertise of its advanced trading infrastructure to unwind risk strategically. This capability ensures the preservation of the user’s assets while maintaining the stability and integrity of the collateral pool.

### Off-exchange Custody

All users’ collateral are safeguarded through a combination of off-exchange solutions with qualified custodians, multi-party computation (MPC) and multi-signature schemes, and hardware-managed keys, ensuring that user assets remain secure and accessible at all times.&#x20;

By limiting on-exchange storage, Falcon ensures that user funds remain insulated from risks such as counterparty defaults or exchange failures.
