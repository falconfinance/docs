# Transparency

### Transparency

To uphold transparency, Falcon provides users with access to comprehensive information on the status of their assets and the overall health of the system. In addition, Falcon offers daily transparency into reserves, segmented by asset classes such as stablecoins, blue-chip tokens, altcoins, and other collateral types.&#x20;

To give users a clearer understanding of the protocol's performance, Falcon's transparency dashboard will include information such as:

* Current sUSDf-to-USDf Value
* Total Backing
* USDf Supply and Price
* sUSDf Supply and Annual Percentage Yield (APY)
* Reserves Breakdown (by asset type):
  * Stablecoins
  * Others
* Reserves Breakdown (onchain/offchain):
  * Offchain
    * Custodians (Ceffu, Fireblocks)&#x20;
    * Portfolio Holdings (Binance, Bybit)&#x20;
  * Onchain
    * Staking
    * Liquidity Pools

### Proof-of-Reserves (PoR)

To further bolster transparency and trust, Falcon undertakes rigorous quarterly and annual audits conducted by independent third-party firms. The quarterly audits cover a detailed POR that consolidates on-chain and off-chain data, including aggregated metrics from decentralized exchanges (DEXs), centralized exchanges (CEXs), and wallets.&#x20;

Additionally, Falcon commissions ISAE3000 assurance reports every quarter to verify compliance with industry standards. These reports focus on key aspects such as security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy, ensuring that the protocol operates at the highest standards of reliability and accountability.

Annual external audits on issuing entities are also conducted. These audits, covering jurisdictions such as BVI and Panama, provide further assurance of the protocolâ€™s adherence to global best practices\
in financial management and regulatory compliance.

All reports are published under the Attestations section on Falcon's transparency dashboard, enabling users to verify the integrity of the collateral backing their assets at any time.\
&#xNAN;_&#x54;he first external audit report will be released at the end of Q2 2025._
