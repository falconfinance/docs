# Insurance Fund

Falcon will maintain an on-chain, verifiable insurance fund to act as a safeguard for all protocol users. A portion of Falcon's monthly profits will be allocated to the insurance fund, reinforcing its commitment to users’ asset protection.&#x20;

This ensures the insurance fund grows in tandem with the protocol’s adoption and Total Value Locked (TVL). The insurance fund operates as a financial buffer, designed to mitigate rare periods of zero or negative yields and function as the last resort bidder for USDf in open markets.&#x20;

In an unlikely scenario, Falcon may augment reserves during periods of exceptional market stress to ensure the protocol’s stability. Besides serving as a financial buffer, the fund also serves multiple other purposes, including compensation for unforeseen risks, and mitigation of potential losses.&#x20;

The insurance fund is held in a multi-signature address comprising of internal Falcon members\
and potential external contributors.
