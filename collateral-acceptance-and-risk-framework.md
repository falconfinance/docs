# Collateral Acceptance & Risk Framework

Falcon Finance maintains a dataâ€‘driven framework for selecting the **Supported Collaterals** that can be pledged to mint USDf. The objective is to safeguard USDfâ€™s peg and ensure that all accepted assets exhibit sufficient market liquidity, price transparency, and riskâ€‘adjusted resilience.

> These guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be updated in response to evolving market conditions or regulatory requirements.

### Eligibility Screening Workflow

<table><thead><tr><th width="40"></th><th width="141.91015625">Stage</th><th>Check </th><th width="395.6328125">Decision Logic</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Primary Listing </td><td>Is the token listed on Binance Markets?</td><td><p>No â†’ Reject</p><p>Yes â†’ proceed to Stage 2</p></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Market Availability </td><td>Is the token available in both Spot and Perpetual Futures on Binance?</td><td>Yes â†’ Accept<br>Only Spot or Only Futures â†’ proceed to Stage 3<br>Neither â†’ Reject</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Crossâ€‘Exchange Verification</td><td>Is the token listed on Topâ€‘10 CEXs or leading DEXs with verifiable depth and nonâ€‘synthetic volume?</td><td>Yes â†’ Accept<br>No â†’ Reject</td></tr></tbody></table>

Tokens that pass all three stages are classified as eligible collateral and can be accepted on Falcon Finance.

### Quantitative Risk Assessment

Each token is scored across four marketâ€‘quality dimensions.&#x20;

A colorâ€‘coded tier (ðŸŸ¢ Low, ðŸŸ¡ Medium, ðŸ”´ High) is assigned per factor.

## Composite Risk Grade&#x20;

* An asset is **Eligible** when **no factor is rated ðŸ”´** and â‰¤â€¯one factor is ðŸŸ¡.
* Assets with two ðŸŸ¡ scores are **Conditionally Eligible** and may receive a **higher overcollaterization ratio**.
* Any ðŸ”´ score triggers **Rejection** or immediate review if already listed.



## Overcollaterization Ratio

Falcon applies dynamic overcollaterization ratios that reflect the composite risk grade and underlying asset volatility. Specific ratios are published on the [Falcon Finance Mint page](https://app.falcon.finance/swap/mint) and may change as market conditions evolve.
