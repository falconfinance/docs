# Falcon Miles Multipliers

Perryverse NFTs integrate directly with Falcon Miles, providing holders with boosted multipliers based on their Perry's traits. The multiplier system operates on a **rotating schedule**, rewarding different traits at different times.

Each Perry comes with multiple traits. Six are selected per rotation for **1.1x–1.5x** Miles boosts.

#### How Trait Multipliers Work

* **Trait Categories**: Each Perry has multiple trait categories (e.g., Eyewear, Background, Clothing, etc.)
* **Specific Traits**: Within each category, your Perry has a specific trait (e.g., Eyewear → Sunglasses)
* **Rotating Boosts**: Every **3 weeks**, the boosted traits rotate to reward different trait combinations
* **Stacking Multipliers**: If your Perry has multiple boosted traits during a rotation, the multipliers stack

### Rotation Schedule

| Cycle           | Duration       | How It Works                                             |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rotation Period | 3 weeks        | Boosted traits change every 3 weeks                      |
| Announcement    | Start of Cycle | Boosted traits announced via official channels.          |
| Application     | Immediate      | Multipliers apply automatically to qualifying Perry NFTs |

Note: While trait multipliers become active immediately on rotation day, your boosted Miles balance will only reflect the increase one day later. Falcon Miles uses end-of-day data snapshots for calculations, so there is a 24-hour delay between when multipliers take effect and when boosted Miles appear in your account

#### Example

If the current rotation boosts:

* **Eyewear → Sunglasses**: Your Perry with Sunglasses earns bonus Miles
* **Background → Cosmic**: Your Perry with Cosmic background earns bonus Miles
* **Both traits**: Your Perry with both Sunglasses AND Cosmic background earns stacked bonuses

#### Maximum Daily Miles

> &#x20;**Daily Cap**: The maximum possible Miles that can be earned from boosted traits is **20,000,000 (20M) Miles per day**.

This cap applies to trait-based multipliers from Perryverse NFTs. Plan your holdings accordingly to maximize your Miles accumulation within this daily limit.
