  When you mint or acquire a Perryverse NFT, you initially receive a Perry Egg.
  To reveal your Perry and unlock trait-based Miles multipliers, you must hatch
  your egg through a burn-to-reveal mechanism.

# Perry Egg Hatching Mechanism

#### How Hatching Works

1. **Hold a Perry Egg**: Acquire a Perry Egg NFT through minting or secondary market purchase
2. **Initiate Hatching**: Access the hatching interface on the [Falcon App](https://app.falcon.finance/perryverse)
3. **Burn the Egg**: Confirm the transaction to burn your Perry Egg NFT
4. **Receive Your Perry**: A new Perry NFT is minted to your wallet with randomized traits
5. **Unlock Multipliers**: Your Perry's traits now qualify for rotating Miles multipliers

#### Important Notes

* **Burning is irreversible**: Once you hatch your Perry Egg, the egg NFT is permanently destroyed
* **Traits are randomized**: The traits your Perry receives are determined at the moment of hatching
* **Rarity is fixed**: Your Perry's rarity tier is set upon hatching and cannot be changed
* **Immediate utility**: Your Perry immediately begins qualifying for trait-based Miles multipliers after hatching, contingent on your NFT possessing traits that qualify for boosted miles.
